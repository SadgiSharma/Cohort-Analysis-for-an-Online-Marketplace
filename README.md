# Cohort-Analysis-for-an-Online-Marketplace
Cohort Analysis to find repeat rate of customers based on the data provided by an Online Marketplace. (Python)

Cohort analysis is a big part of analytics, related to the lifecycle of a customer. It is a basic segmentation of users which, however, is essential, as it will solve 3 problems simultaneously:

1. It will help to calculate the RR (Retention Rate) and to retain users effectively.

2. It will allow to predict the LTV (Lifetime Value) and to work on improving this indicator.

3. It will advise you how to optimise marketing campaigns and product features.
